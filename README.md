# 🏋️‍♂️ THE PYTHON GYM

Welcome to **THE PYTHON GYM** — my personal practice arena where I strengthen my Python skills through industry-focused questions, real interview challenges, and hands-on coding exercises.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside?

This repository is organized into folders that each focus on **practical Python problem-solving**:

- **`leetcode50/`** — 50 LeetCode-style Pandas questions to master data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.
- **`stratascratch/`** — Real-world data questions adapted from StrataScratch to simulate interview scenarios asked by top tech companies.
- **`campusx/`** — A collection of Python interview questions inspired by CampusX, covering a range of core Python concepts tested in industry interviews.

I regularly expand this repo with new folders, datasets, and question sets — so expect to find **fresh challenges** and **new topics** over time.

## ✅ What I’m Achieving Here

**Learn:** Practice core and advanced Python topics, especially focusing on data manipulation, analysis, and problem-solving.

**Practice:** Solve practical coding questions that mirror real interview tasks and business data problems.

**Improve:** Build a robust habit of daily practice — just like training in a gym — to stay sharp, confident, and industry-ready.

## 🔑 Why This Repo Matters

✔️ **Real-World Skills:** All questions mimic scenarios faced by data analysts, data scientists, and Python developers in actual jobs.

✔️ **Interview-Ready:** Many problems are inspired by real interview rounds at companies like Tesla, Google, Meta, LinkedIn, Shopify, Microsoft, and more.

✔️ **Always Growing:** This is not a static repo — I treat it as a live coding gym, adding new questions, folders, and solutions as I level up.

## 📈 Key Takeaways (So Far)

- **Consistent practice beats passive learning.** The more I code, the more confident I get.
- **Pandas and Python are core tools** for solving real-world data problems.
- **A well-organized practice repo** helps me (and you!) showcase commitment, discipline, and readiness for industry roles.

## 📬 Stay Tuned

I plan to add:
- More Python core practice sets.
- Additional LeetCode or HackerRank exercises.
- SQL, data structures & algorithms, and more — all in the same *gym*.
